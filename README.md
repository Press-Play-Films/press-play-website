## How can I deploy this project?

### Option 1: Use Lovable's built-in publishing

Simply open [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/projects/f43c1bc0-45b5-42b4-aaa3-fa041342ae04) and click on Share -> Publish.

### Option 2: Deploy to Netlify with a custom domain

If you want to use your own domain, follow these steps:

1. **Push your code to GitHub** (if not already there)

2. **Sign up or log in to Netlify**
   - Go to [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) and create an account or log in

3. **Create a new site**
   - Click "New site from Git"
   - Connect to your GitHub repository
   - Configure build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Publish directory: `dist`

4. **Add your custom domain**
   - Go to Site settings > Domain management
   - Click "Add domain"
   - Enter your domain name (e.g., pressp.vip)
   - Follow Netlify's instructions to verify domain ownership
   - Update your domain's DNS settings to point to Netlify's servers

5. **Configure environment variables** (if needed)
   - Go to Site settings > Build & deploy > Environment
   - Add any required environment variables

### Option 3: Deploy to Vercel

Vercel is another excellent option for deploying React apps:

1. Create an account at [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
2. Import your GitHub repository
3. Configure the build settings (similar to Netlify)
4. Add your custom domain in the Vercel dashboard

## I want to use a custom domain - is that possible?

While Lovable doesn't directly support custom domains, you can deploy your project to a service like Netlify or Vercel (see instructions above) and connect your domain there.

For more information on using custom domains with alternative deployment methods, visit our docs: [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/tips-tricks/custom-domain/)
